## Description

The **Canvas Api** provides a means for drawing graphics via Javascript and the Html `Canvas` element.Among other things,it can be used for animation,game graphics,data visualization,photo manipulation,and real-time video progress.

## basic exampple

```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
```

The `Document.getElementById()` method gets a reference to the HTML `<canvas`> element. Next, the `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()` method gets that element's contextâ€”the thing onto which the drawing will be rendered.

The actual drawing is done using the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` interface. The `fillStyle` property makes the rectangle green. The `fillRect()` method places its top-left corner at (10, 10), and gives it a size of 150 units wide by 100 tall.

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillStyle = "green";
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);
```
